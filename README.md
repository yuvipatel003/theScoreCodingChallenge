# theScore "NBA Team Viewer" Interview Question
At theScore, we're always looking for intelligent and resourceful Android developers to join our growing team. To help us evaluate new talent, we have created this take-home interview question. This challenge would take few hours to finish, we advice to read the requirement carefully. If you have any question please don't hasitate to ask. 

**All candidates must complete this before the possibility of an in-person interview. During the in-person interview, your submitted project will be used as the base for questions.**

### Why a take-home interview?
In-person coding interviews can be stressful and can hide some people's full potential. A take-home gives you a chance work in a less stressful environment and showcase your talent.

We want you to be at your best and most comfortable.

### Understanding the problem

* `players`: (List of players on the team)
  * `first`: (Player's first name)
  * `last`: (Player's last name)
  * `position`: (Player's position)
  * `number`: (Player's jersey number)


```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "full_name": "Boston Celtics",
  "wins": 45,
  "losses": 20,
  "players": [
    {
      "id": 37729,
      "first_name": "Kadeem",
      "last_name": "Allen",
      "position": "SG",
      "number": 45
    },
  ]
